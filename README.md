# COVID-19 Data Analysis System

## Introduction
The COVID-19 Data Analysis System is a Python-based project aimed at analyzing, visualizing, and performing mathematical operations on COVID-19 data. 
The system fetches data from reliable sources, processes it, and provides insights into various aspects of the pandemic.

## Features
- Data fetching from reliable sources
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data analysis and visualization
- Mathematical operations on data
- User-friendly command-line interface
